1. I created a repository
2. Initialized in my Terminal
3. Added README.md file
4. Push in GitHub:
   - git status
   - git add . 
   - git commit -m "added README.md file"
   - git push origin main
5. To edit, open the README.md file from my local folder using sublime.
6. Edit codes in sublime then push to GitHub again, then check GitHub if changes were applied. 
   
*In my case, I'm having a hard time adding the README file same time as creating my repository. I got confused if it is initialized first in GitHub than in my Terminal. I choose this path since I figured it out on my own and it works for me. Others might find it as a long process but I'll do it for now since I still can't figure out how to do it same as how others do it in YouTube.*
